This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

For this task, I run `Part 2_Express` project. Also need to create data items first. So please hit this endpoint **once**.

```
POST localhost:2000/insert/item-part-3
```
